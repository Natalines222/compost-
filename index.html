        <h2> Composting Continues</h2>
        <p>COVID-19 has interrupted and changed many facets of our lives, but little has changed for millions of microrganisms that exist inside compost. A handful of community gardners and environmental educators are continuing to turn food scraps
          into dark, nutrient-rich soil throughout the winter. "People think gardening doesn't happen during the winter months, but I say that winter is composting season. This is when we feed the soil for spring and summer," said Jae Lee composter
          and self described "earthling," someone who is a caregiver for the earth including the microorganisms. In the midst of covid-related budget cuts made to the Department of Sanitation of New York's (DSNY) Organics Program earlier this year,
          the suspension of the brown-bin food scrap pickup - known as curbside pickup - food scrap drop off, and community composting, some New York City residents as well as advocates were alarmed. "We had to strategize and figure out where to get
          funding and we also decided to
          start picking up compost ourselves as well as accept compost from community members and microhaulers," said Earth Matter, Executive Director and environmental educator Marisa DeDominicis. Earth Matter is one of seven sites that partners
          with DSNY to manage food scrap drop off and community composting. They also received funding from the city agency. </p>

        <h2>Compost City</h2>
        <p> Some environmental advocates like Earth Matter are trying to make composting a city mandate. DSNY has to pick up garbarge and recycling, but COVID has shown that brown-bin food scrap pick up can be put on the chopping block. Program
          Manager
          of the Organics Program at DSNY, Andrew Hoyles, was disheartened about the curbside pickup being suspended as he and others in the Organics Program imagined a robust composting system that was a part of New York City living. "No matter who
          you are or where you live, you would have an outlet for composting," said Hoyle. In November, the city
          reinstated $2.8 million to resume food scrap drop off and community composting. The curbside food scrap pickup will be suspended through 2021. The city aims to save $21.1 million in fiscal year 2021 by not resuming the program.

        <h2>Closed Loops</h2>
        <p>Composting is not dirty business although many people think of it that way.
          "I went my whole life treating it [compost] like garbage and then there was this switch in my brain, " said Corey Bernstein, a volunteer at Phoenix Community Garden in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn and who works with Lee. Lee has managed various
          composting
          projects across the city over the past ten years and she, along with other composting organizations and independent composters, will continue to do so despite curbed funding. Earlier this fall, she looped in local cafes in Ocean Hill like
          Beets Cafe, Daily Press and Nelly's to collect their coffee grounds, egg shells and other non-meat food products to be composted. Small decorations adorn a white 5-gallon food grade bin that she delivers to the cafes. Volunteers and garden
          members pick up the bins and bring them to the garden. Lee is hoping to create a closed loop food system where food scraps are being collected from local establishments and community members, which will be
          repurposed for feeding the soil.
